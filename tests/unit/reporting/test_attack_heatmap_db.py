"""Attack time heatmap over findings that have no timestamp.

``findings.timestamp`` is nullable (LogLM parquet ingest leaves it NULL when a
row carries no ``event_start_time``). The heatmap loaded every finding in the
window and called ``timestamp.weekday()`` on each, so one undated finding
turned the whole ``/api/analytics`` response into a 500.

DB-backed because the binning is done by Postgres: the day index has to come
out the way Python's ``weekday()`` numbers it (Monday=0 .. Sunday=6), not the
way ``extract(dow ...)`` does (Sunday=0).
