"""The frozen contract answers at the address it promises, in a real install.

`core/api/v1/contract.snapshot.json` is what external callers are handed, and
`core/api/v1/README.md` tells them to use it. Neither is worth anything if the
path only answers on a machine that has not built the frontend.

The SPA fallback in `services/api/main.py` is registered only when
`clients/web/build/index.html` exists, and the backend CI job never builds the
frontend -- so every test that talks to the app talks to a routing table that
no install has. These tests put the fallback back.
