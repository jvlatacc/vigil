"""A clean install can create its first admin, sign in, and reach an
authenticated route (#914).

``POST /api/auth/bootstrap`` and the login screen that calls it were wired long
before anything exercised them: every development environment ran with the
``DEV_MODE`` bypass, so the authenticated first-run had never been proven. This
drives the chain a browser performs against an **empty** database — bootstrap
status, first-admin creation, login, an authenticated call — and checks the two
doors close behind it: bootstrap refuses once an account exists, and the same
route answers 401 without a session.

The database is a scratch one created here (``roles`` seeded, ``users`` empty)
so the test never depends on, or truncates, whatever the configured database
holds. The app's shared ``DatabaseManager`` is retargeted at it for the module
and restored afterwards; the request unit of work and ``AuthService``'s own
sessions all go through that manager, so overriding a single dependency would
not have been enough.

Skips when no local Postgres or Redis answers (token revocation is fail-closed,
so a session cannot be verified without Redis) — except under ``CI``, where a
missing service is a provisioning failure and must fail rather than pass by
skipping.
