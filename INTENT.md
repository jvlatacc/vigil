# Declared daemon intent: what the SOC daemon may do unattended.
#
# Every key here is an existing DaemonConfig knob; there is no key without a
# reader. Observe mode: at startup the daemon logs each key whose declared
# value differs from the effective one (declared, effective, source, and
# whether applying the declared value would tighten or loosen autonomy).
# Nothing is enforced and nothing is written. Check from a shell with
#   python -m services.daemon.intent
# Values below equal the shipped defaults, so a fresh checkout reports none.

# Daemon intent

This file records what the Vigil daemon is meant to do without a human in the
loop. The frontmatter above is the machine-readable part; this body is for the
operator and is not parsed.

## Why a file

The knobs above already exist as typed environment variables, as overlays the
Settings UI writes to the database, and as defaults in code. None of those has
a history a reviewer can read: a change to `DAEMON_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` leaves
no trace of who made it or why. This file lives in the repository, so a change
to declared intent is a commit with an author, a message and a review.

## What the daemon does with it

Observe mode only. At startup the daemon reads this file and, for every key
whose declared value differs from the value it is actually running with, logs
one line: the declared value, the effective value, where the effective value
came from (`env`, `db` or `default`), and whether applying the declared value
would `tighten` or `loosen` autonomy. It then runs exactly as it would have
without the file. A missing or unreadable file is one warning.

`python -m services.daemon.intent` prints the same table without starting the
daemon. Override the path with `VIGIL_INTENT_PATH`.

`python -m services.daemon.intent --replay` re-decides every finding that has
a triage confidence and every approval action in a window (default 7 days,
`--since 7d`) under this file and under the effective config, and prints the
rows whose outcome would differ. It does not write.

## Editing

Change a value here when the intended autonomy changes, and say why in the
commit message. If the effective config disagrees after a restart, the log
tells you which of env, database or default is overriding the declaration.
