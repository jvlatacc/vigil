# Changelog

## Upgrade notes (unreleased)

* **agents:** the Response workflow can now propose honey-routing: incident-response and full-investigation runs learn to propose `honey_route` for a corroborated recon source — via a `proposed_actions` entry or the new `propose_honey_route` backend tool — and the orchestrator mints those proposals as `honey_route` rows (not the unknown-type `custom` fallback), deduped per attacker (`honey_route:<ip>`). `propose_honey_route` needs no permission and steers nothing: the row is `human_only` and waits for an analyst. `execute_honey_route` runs an already-approved honey-route row through the same executor as the daemon's sweep, and refuses an unbound caller exactly as `approve_action` does.
* **console:** Settings › AI models now shows Keys, Spending limit and Advanced as cards under the provider cards, and the Virtual Keys and Operations tabs are gone. Spending limit edits only the one virtual key Vigil sends (ceiling, reset period, requests per minute; raising or removing the ceiling asks you to confirm); creating, listing and deleting other virtual keys is Bifrost's own UI. "Retry a local model that stops responding" moves to Advanced, with its restart and retry-count rows shown while it is on. No API change.
* **ai-config:** `PUT` and `DELETE /api/ai/config/{component}` now record the signed-in user in `ai_model_configs.updated_by` (returned as `updated_by`) and write one `config_audit_log` row (`config_type` `ai_model`, old and new `{provider_id, model_id}`) when the assignment changes. Settings › AI models replaces the Model Assignment and Custom agents tabs with provider cards and a "Model for each agent" table; changing the Chat (Default) model asks you to confirm.
* **llm:** `openrouter` is a provider type (`POST /api/llm/providers`), with models addressed as OpenRouter ids such as `anthropic/claude-haiku-5.5`. A model on it is priced from the gateway's `openrouter` datasheet, then its vendor's (`claude-haiku-5.5` looked up as `claude-haiku-5-5`), so a hunt no longer parks after one iteration on `unpriced`. A model assignment's `settings.effort` (`low`, `medium`, `high`; set per component in Settings › AI models) is sent to OpenRouter as `reasoning: {effort}` and to Anthropic as `output_config.effort`, on hunts and document condensing; other components still run at the model's own default ([#1931](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/issues/1931)).
* **hunt:** the hypothesis `/hunt` proposes from an attached document is now the document's own: its stated hunting hypothesis verbatim, else one testable sentence the `summarization` model writes from it, and the indicator template only when neither is available. A document already being hunted still gets a proposal, with an "Open its case" door to the running hunt; `POST /api/workflows/threat-hunt/coverage` now returns a `proposal` for a `running` report too, and each `in_flight` row carries its `case_id` ([#1918](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/issues/1918)). The `check_hunt_coverage` agent tool is unchanged.
* **orchestrator:** `OrchestratorSettingsConfig` now has bounds, so `POST /api/config/orchestrator` answers 422 for a value outside them (for example `max_concurrent_agents` 0 or 1000). `GET /api/config/orchestrator` also serves `defaults` and `bounds`, and still loads a config saved before the bounds existed so it can be corrected. 0 never meant unlimited to the daemon; it is the tightest cap, so Settings › Limits and autonomy no longer offers "Unlimited" ([#1648](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/issues/1648)).
* **skills:** `POST /api/skills` now answers 422 when `body` (the Steps) is empty or whitespace, including when saving a copy of a skill under a new name with `source`; send the steps with the copy. Skills already on disk with an empty body still load and list. The skill drawer keeps Save off until When to use it and Steps are filled, and says which is missing ([#1879](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/issues/1879)).
* **hunt:** `/hunt` takes an attached document (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, PNG, JPG, Markdown, text or HTML, up to 25 MB), read on the server by LiteParse ([#1860](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/issues/1860)). Office files need LibreOffice on the API host (the images do not ship it), and OCR for images and scanned pages needs Tesseract's `eng.traineddata`, which LiteParse downloads from GitHub on first use: an air-gapped install must put that file in a folder and set `TESSDATA_PREFIX` to it, or only text-layer PDFs, Markdown, text and HTML can be attached. Text over 64 KB is condensed on the `summarization` model, so assign one in Settings first.
* **ai-config:** `PUT` and `DELETE /api/ai/config/{component}` now record the signed-in user in `ai_model_configs.updated_by` (returned as `updated_by`) and write one `config_audit_log` row (`config_type` `ai_model`, old and new `{provider_id, model_id}`) when the assignment changes. Settings › AI models replaces the Model Assignment and Custom agents tabs with provider cards and a "Model for each agent" table; changing the Chat (Default) model asks you to confirm.
* **sla:** Settings › SLA policies is a board table with an inline editor and hours-and-minutes duration pickers, and `GET /api/sla-policies/{id}/usage` takes an optional `since` (the table's "Met this month" passes the start of the UTC month). The editor no longer edits `notification_thresholds`, which nothing reads; the table shows the stored values read-only, and the console no longer writes them. Set a policy as default with its "Default for this severity" switch.
* **auth:** `POST /api/orchestrator/enable|disable|kill|investigations/purge` and `PUT /api/analytics/budget` now need `settings.write`, and `DELETE /api/findings/all` needs `findings.delete`; the two wipes write the signed-in user to the config audit log first. `POST /api/config/integrations` answers 400 when a URL, host, region or similar field changes and a stored credential of that integration is not sent again, so a saved credential is never carried to a new destination; enter the credential together with the new URL.
* **orchestrator:** a completed investigation that belongs to a case no longer creates a `case-review` investigation. No `case-review` workflow exists, so each one failed at enqueue and left an `assigned` row and workdir behind ([#1841](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/issues/1841)). Rows already created stay as they are; delete any `workflow_id = 'case-review'` investigations you do not want.
* **auth:** `POST /api/auth/logout` now also revokes a refresh token sent in the request body (`{"refresh_token": ...}`), so a Bearer-flow client can end its refresh token at logout; it was revoked only when it arrived in the cookie. Send it when logging out.
* **api:** the Jira export, the bulk-enrich results and the VStrike inbound push no longer put an exception's text in their response: a failed Jira export answers `JIRA API error: HTTP <status>`, `JIRA API error: could not reach Jira` or `Internal server error`, and a failed item answers `Internal server error` (the detail is in the server log). The exception-text ratchet now also covers response fields set by keyword and error lists.
* **auth:** a refresh token now rotates: `POST /api/auth/refresh` accepts each one once (a replay within 10 seconds, from a browser with several tabs, still succeeds) and answers 401 afterwards, so a client must keep the refresh token the last call returned. The per-user "revoked before" cutoff in Redis now expires after `JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION_DAYS`, and the API logs an error at startup when Redis runs an evicting `maxmemory-policy`, since an evicted revocation key reads as not revoked. Run an external Redis with `noeviction`.
* **api:** a failure the API did not expect no longer returns its exception text (database host, SQL, upstream bodies, file paths) to the caller. Orchestrator, VStrike, custom-agent, custom-integration, detection-rule and LLM-provider routes answer `Internal server error` with a `trace_id` (the detail is in the server log); `/api/config/*`, `/api/storage/*`, the insights refresh and the chat stream carry that same text in their `error`/`message` field. Typed 4xx errors keep their messages.
* **integrations:** a Custom Integration's password-typed fields are now stored in the encrypted secrets store, like a built-in integration's, and are no longer returned by `GET /api/config/integrations`, written to the database row, the audit log or `integrations_config.json`. A value saved earlier stays in those places until the integration is saved again (the next save moves it to the secrets store under `<CUSTOM_ID>_<FIELD>`), and in `config_audit_log` history: rotate any credential you entered. A generated server must read a credential with `resolve_fields` (the Builder now generates that); one that reads it from `get_integration_config` gets nothing once the field is stripped.
* **orchestrator:** `POST /api/orchestrator/kill` now writes `orchestrator.settings.enabled = false`, so the daemon stops launching investigations (it did not before), and records the signed-in user in the config audit log. It still does not cancel a run already executing on the agent worker. When the daemon cannot count in-flight investigations or read the hour's spend, it now holds intake instead of launching without a limit.
* **memory:** the Distil now strips control characters from, and caps at 2000 characters, the statement, rationale and reason it stores, and a run's recalled notes reach the Hunt Lead scrubbed, capped and inside a `<vigil:recalled_memory>` block. Rows stored earlier are bounded when read, so nothing needs re-deriving. A replay of a run recorded before this change rebuilds the opening turn in the new form, so its bytes differ from what that run was shown.
* **auth:** only an access token now authenticates `/api/*` routes. A refresh token, or a signed token with a missing or unknown `token_type`, presented as a Bearer header or in the `access_token` cookie answers 401. A script that sent its refresh token as the Bearer credential must send the access token, and use `POST /api/auth/refresh` to renew it ([#1712](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/issues/1712)).
* **splunk:** the Splunk integration (and the Cribl Stream form) now verifies the server's TLS certificate unless you turn it off. An install that never set "Verify SSL Certificate" now verifies, so a Splunk on port 8089 with its default self-signed certificate stops connecting: set the CA Certificate Path (`SPLUNK_CA_CERT_PATH`) to the CA that signed it, or set `verify_ssl` to false (`SPLUNK_VERIFY_SSL=false`) to keep the old behaviour. A stored `verify_ssl: false` is left as it is.
* **response:** isolations recorded before [#1339](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/pull/1339) were never executed: the stub reported success without isolating the host. `python scripts/migrate_schema.py` now marks those `isolate_host` rows `failed` (`execution_result.message` keeps the original `(MOCK)` text and gains an `error`), and logs the hosts. Those hosts were not contained, and a new isolation for one of them is no longer answered with "already isolated" ([#1686](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/issues/1686)).
* **auth:** role permissions are now enforced on writes, not only on login. Case, finding, approval, agent-run and `/api/config` writes, chat, and the chat/MCP `approve_action`/`reject_action` tools answer 403 to a role that lacks `cases.write`, `findings.write`, `ai_decisions.approve`, `ai_chat.use` or `settings.write`/`integrations.write` (the seeded Viewer is read-only; Analyst and Senior Analyst no longer change settings). Approvals, merges and run directives record the signed-in user; the `approved_by`, `rejected_by`, `merged_by` and `actor` request fields are accepted and ignored. `POST /api/workflows/runs/{id}/resume` answers 409 when more than one approval is pending. Grant a role the permission in `roles.permissions` if it should keep an action.
* **approvals:** a confidence an agent or the daemon's triage model names no longer releases a response action. `create_approval_action` (MCP and chat) always queues the action for a person and refuses a confidence outside 0..1; the daemon's triage reply is ignored for a confidence outside 0..1, a repeated key or an action outside isolate/block/investigate/monitor/dismiss; and the executor leaves alone an approved action no person decided. Agent prompts no longer promise auto-approval. Operator directive text is capped at 2000 characters.
* **workflows:** the workflow listing (`GET /api/workflows`, `/api/v1/workflows`) reports the last 7 days instead of today: `runs_today` is gone, replaced by `runs_7d`, `success_rate` (a 0..1 fraction) and `success_level` (good/fair/poor), and `mean_cost_usd` now averages the finished runs of the same window ([#1624](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/issues/1624)). The Workflows tab is a column of cards in place of the table; its Agents, Last edited and Trust columns are gone.
* **workflows:** each workflow now has an on/off switch in the console (`PUT /api/workflows/{id}/enabled`, stored as `workflows.disabled`), and nothing starts a workflow while it is off ([#1623](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/issues/1623)). `DAEMON_THREAT_HUNT_ENABLED` and `ORCHESTRATOR_SHADOW_ADJUDICATION` are gone from the environment, compose and Helm values; setting them has no effect. The scheduled hunt is on unless you turn `threat-hunt` off; shadow adjudication is off until you turn `shadow-adjudication` on. `incident-response` is where alerts land when nothing else fits and cannot be turned off.
* **logging:** the backend, daemon and llm-worker now write one JSON object per line to stdout and `vigil.log` whether or not `VIGIL_OTEL_ENABLED` is set, each with a `msg_template` field (and `exc_type` on exceptions) for grouping ([#1563](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/issues/1563)). Set `VIGIL_LOG_FORMAT=text` for the old plain format; `./start.sh` in the foreground defaults to text. The daemon's `log_format` is gone. Third-party loggers (httpx, httpcore, sqlalchemy.engine, urllib3, watchfiles, asyncio) are pinned at WARNING.
* **compose:** the State Directory (`master.key`, `secrets.enc`) and `data/investigations` now live in the `vigil_home` and `vigil_investigations` named volumes, shared by `backend`, `soc-daemon` and `llm-worker` ([#1263](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/issues/1263)). The first `up` after this change recreates those containers and drops whatever is still in their writable layers. Save the backend's copy first: `docker cp deeptempo-backend:/home/vigil/.vigil ./vigil-state-backup`. After the upgrade, copy it into the volume and restart: `docker cp ./vigil-state-backup/. deeptempo-backend:/home/vigil/.vigil/ && docker exec -u 0 deeptempo-backend chown -R 1000:1000 /home/vigil/.vigil && docker compose restart backend soc-daemon llm-worker`.
* **desktop:** Bifrost's runtime settings (provider keys, virtual keys, budgets, rate limits) now persist in a `bifrost_data` named volume, so they survive quitting the app ([#1452](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/issues/1452)). Earlier versions kept them in an anonymous volume that every quit orphaned; those are not migrated, so re-enter any Bifrost settings made in its UI once. Providers seeded from environment variables come back on their own. Reclaim the orphaned volumes with `docker volume prune`.
* **compose:** Bifrost's request log (`logs.db`) now lives in the `bifrost_data` volume, so gateway log history, cost time series and `recalculate-cost` survive a container recreate ([#1454](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/issues/1454)). It was written to `/app/logs.db` in the container's writable layer. Applies to the server and desktop standalone stacks. The config store is untouched, so no volume reset is needed. History already in `/app/logs.db` is not migrated: the first recreate drops it, as every recreate did before. Snapshots still leave `logs.db` out, and a restore moves the live one aside into `.pre-restore-<stamp>` in the Bifrost data directory rather than restoring it.
