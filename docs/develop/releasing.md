# Releasing

How Vigil is versioned and released.

## Versioning Policy

Vigil follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

- **`0.x.y` (current)** — Pre-stable. `feat:` commits bump the minor
  (`0.1.0` → `0.2.0`) and may include breaking changes to agent prompts,
  workflow schemas, MCP integration interfaces, environment variables, or
  API shapes. `fix:` commits bump the patch (`0.1.0` → `0.1.1`) and are
  always backward-compatible.
- **`1.0.0` and later** — Stable. Breaking changes require a major bump.
  Vigil ships `1.0.0` once the agent and workflow schemas are considered
  stable enough to commit to.

## What Gets Versioned

| File                          | Field                              | Managed by release-please     |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `VERSION`                     | (whole file)                       | yes                           |
| `infra/helm/vigil/Chart.yaml`       | `appVersion`                       | yes                           |
| `infra/helm/vigil/Chart.yaml`       | `version`                          | yes (lockstep with appVersion)|
| `clients/web/package.json`       | `version`                          | yes                           |
| `clients/web/package-lock.json`  | `version` (root + `packages['']`)  | yes                           |

See "Chart version vs appVersion" below for why both chart fields are
bumped together.

The Python backend reads `VERSION` directly at import time (see
`core/version.py`), so the FastAPI app version, the
`core.version.__version__` attribute, and the `/health` endpoint's `version`
field all stay in sync with `VERSION` automatically. No release-please
configuration is needed for the backend.

## How a Release Happens

Releases are driven by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please).
Maintainers do not hand-bump versions or hand-tag releases — both are
automated.

1. Every push to `main` runs `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`.
2. release-please reads commits since the last tag and decides the next
   version from [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
   prefixes in commit messages on `main` (for squash-merged PRs, the PR
   title becomes the commit — maintainers should adjust PR titles to
   match the convention before squashing):

   - `fix: ...` → patch bump (`0.1.0` → `0.1.1`)
   - `feat: ...` → minor bump (`0.1.0` → `0.2.0`)
   - `feat!: ...` or commits with `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the body → minor
     bump while in `0.x`, major bump from `1.0.0` onward
   - `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `perf:` appear in the
     changelog but don't trigger a bump on their own
   - Commits with no recognized prefix go under "Other" and don't
     contribute to version selection
3. It opens (or updates) a single **release PR** titled
   `chore(main): release X.Y.Z`. The PR bumps `VERSION`,
   `Chart.yaml` `appVersion` and `version`, `clients/web/package.json`
   `version`, `clients/web/package-lock.json` (both `$.version` and
   `$.packages[''].version`), and updates `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. The release PR stays open and accumulates more commits as they merge.
   This is the grouping mechanism — every commit since the last release
   lives in one PR until you ship.
5. When ready, a maintainer merges the
   release PR. The merge causes release-please to push tag `vX.Y.Z` and
   create a GitHub Release.
6. The tag push triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds
   and publishes artifacts.

The only human decision per release is **when to merge the release PR**.

## Forcing a specific version

release-please normally picks the next version from Conventional Commit
prefixes — highest bump wins (`feat:` → minor, `fix:` → patch, etc.).
Sometimes you need to override that: to unstick a stalled release PR,
to reserve a milestone version, or to skip a number on purpose. Push
an empty commit to `main` with a `Release-As:` trailer:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty \
  -m "chore: release 0.1.2" \
  -m "Release-As: 0.1.2"
git push origin main
```

The next release-please run reads the trailer and forces the release
PR to use that exact version, regardless of what the Conventional
Commits in the window would otherwise compute. The override is
one-shot — subsequent merged commits go back to normal accounting.

A common reason to reach for this: `ct lint` is blocking the release
PR because the chart `version` field "didn't bump" — release-please
computed the same patch number that's already on disk (e.g. after a
manual chart-version bump in an earlier PR). Forcing the next patch
gives the chart-testing job a real diff to validate and unblocks the
release.

The opposite trailer also exists: `Release-As: skip` tells
release-please to ignore the commit entirely — useful for `chore:` or
similar commits you don't want appearing in any release's changelog.

## Chart Version vs appVersion

The Helm chart has two version fields:

- **`appVersion`** — the Vigil release the chart deploys.
- **`version`** — the chart packaging version. Helm clients, `helm package`
  tarball names (`vigil-X.Y.Z.tgz`), Helm's local cache, and ArtifactHub all
  key off this field, not `appVersion`. If chart contents change without a
  `version` bump, consumers see "no new chart" even though the bytes
  differ — silent breakage.

release-please bumps **both fields in lockstep** with every release. This
is a deliberate trade-off: it gives up the (rarely-used) ability to ship a
chart-only patch with a chart `version` bump but no app version bump, in
exchange for eliminating a drift footgun that's hard to catch in review
(release-please's YAML library reformats `Chart.yaml` when it edits, which
can produce semantically-equivalent but byte-different output).

| Change                              | `appVersion` | chart `version` |
|-------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Any release-please release          | bumps        | bumps           |

If you ever need a chart-only fix between app releases (e.g. a Helm
template hotfix with no app code change), edit `infra/helm/vigil/Chart.yaml`'s
`version` manually in a separate PR outside the release-please flow. This
is the escape hatch, not the default path.

## GitHub App Setup

The automated flow above depends on a GitHub App (referenced as
`vars.RELEASE_PLEASE_APP_ID` and `secrets.RELEASE_PLEASE_PRIVATE_KEY` in
`release-please.yml`) that mints short-lived tokens at runtime, no
long-lived PATs, no per maintainer ownership. The App is **one time
setup per fork**; once installed, day to day releases need no further
configuration here.

For initial setup or recreating the App, see
[docs/RELEASE_SETUP.md](release-setup.md), covers required
permissions, App creation, `.pem` generation, and where to put the App
ID and private key.

## Manual Release (fallback)

If release-please is broken or unavailable, cut a release by hand. The
manual flow must update **everything** release-please normally manages,
including the manifest file that tracks the last-released version. If
the manifest is not bumped, the next automated run reads its stale
value, thinks the manual release never happened, and opens a release PR
that overwrites it.

1. Open a PR bumping the version to the new release (e.g. `0.2.0`) in
   all of the following:
   - `VERSION`
   - `infra/helm/vigil/Chart.yaml` `appVersion`
   - `infra/helm/vigil/Chart.yaml` `version` (lockstep with `appVersion`)
   - `clients/web/package.json` `version`
   - `clients/web/package-lock.json` — both `$.version` and
     `$.packages[''].version`
   - `.github/.release-please-manifest.json` — set the `"."` entry to
     the new version
   - `CHANGELOG.md` — prepend a section with the new version, date, and
     a summary of changes since the previous tag
2. Merge the PR.
3. Tag and push:
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   git tag -s v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0"
   git push origin v0.2.0
   ```
4. The tag push triggers `release.yml` (build, scan, deploy).
5. **Manually create the GitHub Release** at
   [github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/releases/new](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/releases/new),
   selecting the tag you just pushed. release-please normally creates
   this; in manual mode nothing else will. Use the `CHANGELOG.md`
   section you wrote as the Release body.

## Future Improvements

Tracked separately, not part of the current release flow:

- **Hotfix branches** — once `1.0+` is out and we need to ship fixes for
  older majors, document a `release/X.Y` branch procedure. Not relevant
  while in `0.x` (just ship a patch from `main`).
- **Re-deploy an old tag** — add a `workflow_dispatch` trigger with a
  `tag` input to `release.yml`, so a previously-released version can be
  rebuilt without moving the tag.
