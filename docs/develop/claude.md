# AI Assistant Notes

This file provides guidance for AI assistants (Claude Code and similar tools) working in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Vigil** is an open-source, AI-native Security Operations Center (SOC) platform. It orchestrates 13 specialized AI agents via Claude to perform triage, investigation, threat hunting, forensics, and automated response across 39 security integrations.

**Core pillars:**
- **Agents** — 13 agents defined in `core/agents/builtins.py`, which is the
  authoritative list: triage, investigator, threat_hunter, correlator, responder, reporter,
  mitre_analyst, forensics, threat_intel, compliance, malware_analyst,
  network_analyst, auto_responder.
- **Workflows** — Multi-agent orchestrated playbooks (Incident Response, Full
  Investigation, Threat Hunt, Forensic Analysis, Cloud Incident). Four are
  **compose** playbooks and walk their `phases:` in order. `threat-hunt` declares
  `run_kind: hunt` and runs the **hypothesis loop** instead — a Hunt Lead picks
  each move from what the evidence did to each belief, so its `phases:` block is
  a dispatch roster rather than an order.
- **Integrations** — 39 MCP servers in `mcp-config.json` (Splunk, CrowdStrike, VirusTotal, Shodan, Timesketch, Jira, Slack, etc.). Count only dict-valued keys: the `mcpServers` object also holds 5 `_comment_*` string keys used as section separators.

**Ports:**
- Backend API: `http://localhost:6987`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:6988`
- PostgreSQL: `5432`
- Redis: `6379`

## Development Setup

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jvlatacc/vigil.git
cd vigil
./start.sh           # Starts PostgreSQL (Docker), backend, and frontend
```

### Manual Start

```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure
cd infra/docker && docker compose up -d postgres redis

# 2. Backend (from repo root)
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn services.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 6987 --reload

# 3. Frontend
cd clients/web && npm run dev

# 4. (Optional) Daemon
./start.sh --daemon
```

### Desktop (Electron)

```bash
cd desktop && npm run dev    # builds TS, launches Electron
cd desktop && npm run dist   # packages a .dmg via electron-builder
```

The desktop app drives the stack through `scripts/app_up.sh` / `app_down.sh`
rather than `start.sh`: no `--reload`, no Vite (the built SPA is served by the
backend at :6987), and it **forces `DEV_MODE=false`** because its login and
first-run bootstrap are the point.

### Fresh Environment

```bash
./setup_dev.sh   # Creates venv, installs all Python + npm deps
```

### The Python toolchain

Vigil **provisions** its interpreter rather than discovering one. `.python-version`
pins the version (3.12) and `scripts/lib.sh` uses `uv` to download a standalone
CPython matching it and the host's architecture — so conda, pyenv, or a system
Python on `PATH` cannot influence what the venv is built from. There is no
`find_python`; do not reintroduce `PATH` scanning.

Two details are load-bearing and easy to undo by accident:

- `--python-preference only-managed` is passed as a **flag** to `uv venv`.
  Without it uv reuses any same-version interpreter on `PATH`; as an env var it
  loses to a user who has `UV_PYTHON_PREFERENCE` set.
- A `uv` found on `PATH` is used only when its own target triple matches
  `uname -m`. An x86_64 uv provisions x86_64 interpreters even under
  `only-managed`.

The venv is disposable: one that doesn't match the pin is deleted and rebuilt
(~2s warm) rather than repaired. `install_python_deps` is fatal on failure and
ends by importing what the services need, so breakage reports at its cause.

Dependencies install from **`requirements.lock`** (fully pinned, `--universal`
so one file covers macOS/Linux and arm64/x86_64). `requirements.txt` remains the
list of direct dependencies with acceptable ranges. After changing it, run
`./scripts/update_lock.sh` and commit both. CI and both Docker images install
from the lock too.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12** — provisioned automatically by `uv` (see `.python-version`); no host Python needed
- **Node.js 18+**
- **Docker Desktop** (must be running — used for PostgreSQL and Redis)
- **Git** with submodule support

### Environment Variables

Copy `env.example` to `.env` and populate as needed. `.env` is for
bootstrap-only settings (DB URL, ports, dev flags). LLM provider keys,
integration credentials, and other secrets are configured in the web UI
(Settings → AI / LLM Providers, Settings → Integrations) and stored
encrypted at `~/.vigil/secrets.enc` — see [docs/deploy/state.md](../deploy/state.md).

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `DEV_MODE` | Bypass all authentication | `false` when unset; `env.example` ships `true` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection | auto-set by docker-compose |
| `REDIS_URL` | ARQ job queue | `redis://localhost:6379/0` |
| `BIFROST_URL` | LLM gateway address | `http://bifrost:8080` |
| `SECRETS_BACKEND` | Where new secrets are written | `encrypted` |

> ⚠️ Do **not** put `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, Splunk
> credentials, etc. in `.env`. Use the UI. Placeholder values in `.env`
> are ignored when the encrypted store has a value.

Default dev login: **admin / admin123** (when `DEV_MODE=false`)

### Reading configuration

Config flows through exactly three channels. Do not add `os.getenv` calls —
`tests/unit/_ratchets/test_no_ambient_state.py` fails CI on them.

| Need | Use | Owner |
|------|-----|-------|
| Non-secret setting | `core.config.get_settings().field` | env / `.env` |
| Credential | `core.secrets.get_secret("NAME")` | `~/.vigil/secrets.enc`, then env |
| UI-editable at runtime | `core.platform.runtime_config` / `core.storage.config_service` | `system_config` table |

`core/config.py` is the single definition site: every setting is a typed field
with its default, and `tests/unit/_ratchets/test_settings_env_example.py` fails if a field
is missing from `env.example` or vice versa. `get_settings()` is `lru_cache`d, so
a test that changes env mid-test must call `get_settings.cache_clear()`.

Config file paths go through `core.config.vigil_path()`, which reads from
`~/.vigil` with a fallback to the legacy `~/.deeptempo` copy and always writes to
`~/.vigil`. Pass `write=True` on save paths.

The two legitimate exceptions, both marked `# noqa: ENV001`: exporting env into
spawned MCP child processes (env is their config protocol, so third-party servers
need no adaptation), and genuinely dynamic variable names.

---

## Running Tests

### Python (pytest)

The pytest config lives at **`tests/pytest.ini`** — there is no root-level
`pytest.ini` and no `[tool:pytest]` in `setup.cfg`. A bare `pytest` from the repo
root therefore finds no ini file: markers go unregistered, `--asyncio-mode=auto`
and the coverage flags are skipped, and collection starts from the CWD instead of
`testpaths = tests`. Always scope to `tests/` (or pass `-c tests/pytest.ini`).

```bash
# All tests, with the intended config
pytest tests/

# By marker
pytest tests/ -m unit
pytest tests/ -m integration   # requires running PostgreSQL
pytest tests/ -m "not external_service"   # what CI's main unit job runs

# Specific file
pytest tests/unit/test_backend_tools.py -v
```

Available markers: `unit`, `integration`, `slow`, `auth`, `siem`, `claude`,
`database`, `api`, `daemon`, `performance`, `external_service`.
`--strict-markers` is on, so an unregistered marker is an error — add new ones to
`tests/pytest.ini`.

### Frontend (vitest)

```bash
cd clients/web
npm run test           # watch mode
npm run test:run       # single run with verbose output
npm run test:coverage  # with coverage report
npm run test:ci        # CI mode (JSON output)
```

### Linting

`flake8`, `black` and `isort` **gate CI** over `services/` and `core/`. Pass no
arguments: `setup.cfg` is the only config, and it is the same file pre-commit
reads, so formatting locally cannot produce a tree CI rejects. `mypy` stays
advisory.

`./setup_dev.sh` installs the pinned toolchain and the pre-commit hook. To add it
to an existing venv:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pre-commit install
```

```bash
# Python — the three that gate, scoped as CI scopes them
black services/ core/
isort services/ core/
flake8 services/ core/
mypy services/ core/ --ignore-missing-imports   # advisory

# TypeScript
cd clients/web && npm run lint

# All three at once, on what you changed
pre-commit run --all-files
```

`tests/`, `tools/` and `scripts/` are not gated and have not been cleaned;
pre-commit is scoped to match, so a one-line change there does not arrive
carrying hundreds. Bumping a pin means committing the reformatting it causes,
in `requirements-dev.txt` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` together.

---

## Key Architecture Patterns

### Async-First Backend

All FastAPI endpoints and service methods use `async/await`. Long-running LLM operations go through the ARQ Redis queue (worker pattern). Never add blocking I/O to endpoint handlers.

**The DB layer is synchronous SQLAlchemy — there is no `AsyncSession` in this
repo.** `core/storage/connection.py` exposes a `sessionmaker` and a
`get_db_session()` dependency yielding a plain `Session`. So don't type a dependency as
`AsyncSession` or `await` a session call. Handlers that are fully synchronous can
be plain `def` (FastAPI runs those in a threadpool); handlers that must stay
`async` should push sync DB calls through `asyncio.to_thread` rather than
blocking the loop.

### LLM Traffic Routes Through Bifrost

All LLM calls — including Anthropic — go through the **Bifrost** gateway
(`BIFROST_URL`, default `http://bifrost:8080`), which layers on caching,
centralized cost tracking, and budget enforcement.

- **Never instantiate `Anthropic()` directly.** Import
  `create_anthropic_client` / `create_async_anthropic_client` from
  `core/llm/providers/clients.py` — the single source of truth for client
  construction. The one exception is key-validation endpoints that must hit the
  real upstream to verify a user-supplied credential.
- `core/llm/router/router.py` dispatches and translates Bifrost's budget/rate-limit
  responses (HTTP 402/429) into `BudgetExceeded`.
- `core/llm/providers/registry.py` resolves component→provider+model assignments and
  owns the pricing/capability catalog.
- Provider API keys are **not** in `.env` — they live in the encrypted secrets
  store and are configured via the UI.

### Service Layer

Business logic lives in `core/<domain>/`, not in API route handlers. A router lives with its domain as `core/<domain>/<name>_router.py` (or, until that domain is in `core/`, parked in `services/api/routers/`) and delegates to service classes (e.g. `core/response/approval_service.py`). When adding a feature:
1. Add logic to an existing service or create `core/<domain>/your_feature_service.py`
2. Add the router module (a `router` **and** a `ROUTER_META`) under `core/<domain>/` or `services/api/routers/`
3. Nothing to register — `services/api/discovery.py` scans both locations and mounts it at startup (issues #478, #488)

### MCP Tool Access

Agents access external tools through the MCP protocol. Tool definitions live in `mcp-config.json`, which spawns each in-repo server as its own `python3` subprocess. A vendor's server lives in that vendor's slice as `core/integrations/<vendor>/tool.py` (see [vendor-slices.md](vendor-slices.md) for the inventory and the outbound-HTTP conventions); `tools/mcp/` holds the servers that talk to Vigil's own services; the rest of the 39 entries are external servers. `core/integrations/mcp/service.py` coordinates tool access; the agent-facing tool surface lives in `core/agents/mcp_tools.py`.

### Database

- PostgreSQL 16 via SQLAlchemy ORM — models in `core/storage/models/`, sessions
  and the `get_db` dependency in `core/storage/connection.py`
- Schema initialized by `infra/database/init/` SQL files. **Execution order
  differs by deploy path:** docker-compose mounts the directory at
  `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`, where Postgres runs files in
  **lexicographic filename order** (the `01_`/`04_`/…/`16_` prefixes
  are authoritative there). The Helm chart, by contrast, iterates
  `infra/helm/vigil/values.yaml`'s `dbInit.sqlFiles` list in the **order
  written there** — prefixes are decorative for the chart path
- pgvector extension for embeddings
- Use `core/storage/database_data_service.py` for data access — do not query the DB directly from API handlers
- **`infra/database/init/` is not the whole schema.** `cases`, `findings`,
  `case_evidence`, `case_tasks`, `case_watchers` and `investigations` have no
  `CREATE TABLE` there — `create_all` at startup is the only thing that builds
  them, so an `ALTER TABLE` in a numbered init file for one of them hard-fails
  (the dbInit Job runs before the app ever starts). `users`/`roles` and
  `skills`/`custom_agents`/`workflow_runs`/`custom_workflows` *are* covered.
  Grepping for a table name is misleading — `cases` and `findings` appear in
  9–10 init files, but every hit is a string literal, not DDL
- **Adding a column to one of those ORM-only tables does not reach existing
  databases.** `create_all` is `checkfirst=True` — it creates missing tables and
  never alters existing ones. `check_schema_drift()` in
  `core/storage/connection.py` reports the gap at ERROR and publishes the state
  under `schema` in `/api/health`; `DB_STRICT_SCHEMA=true` makes it fatal.
  Reporting is not fixing: see #562 before relying on
  `scripts/migrate_schema.py`, which only covers columns registered there by
  hand (and #568 — one of its seed migrations still cannot succeed). The check
  compares column *names*, so a changed type or a new `NOT NULL` is drift it
  cannot see

**When adding or modifying an init SQL file under `infra/database/init/`:** the
chart bundles a *copy* under `infra/helm/vigil/files/database-init/` (Helm can
only read files inside the chart directory). You must (1) copy the file
into the chart bundle, (2) add it to `infra/helm/vigil/values.yaml`
`dbInit.sqlFiles` in the correct execution order, and (3) verify with
`helm template ... | grep -E '^[[:space:]]*apply "NEWFILE\.sql"'` that
the dbInit Job script applies it (a bare `grep NEWFILE.sql` false-matches
the ConfigMap key and the SQL header comment). CI catches step 1
(`Helm Chart / Lint and Template` runs `diff -r` between the two
directories). Skipping step 2 is silent (the file is in the ConfigMap
but never applied); skipping step 1 while keeping the file in
`dbInit.sqlFiles` makes the Job hard-fail at runtime — *unless* the
filename already has a row in `_vigil_schema_versions`, in which case
it SKIPs as already-applied (the marker-table check runs before the
file-existence check, so legacy `003_*` ghost rows on v0.1.x upgrades
don't break `helm upgrade --reuse-values`). See
[`../deploy/database-init.md`](../deploy/database-init.md), which also lists
two filenames that are reserved and must never be reused.

### Authentication

- `DEV_MODE=true` bypasses all auth — use for local development
- **Unset means `false`.** The default lives in one place since #520 —
  `dev_mode: bool = False` in `core/config.py` — so anywhere without a `.env`
  (CI, containers, production) enforces auth. `env.example` ships
  `DEV_MODE=true` and `setup_dev.sh` copies it, which is why a local checkout
  behaves as though `true` were the default. Tests that lean on a developer's
  `.env` — e.g. for `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, which is required once `DEV_MODE` is off —
  will fail in CI; set what you need explicitly
- Production uses JWT tokens via `core/auth/auth_service.py` + the middleware in
  `services/api/middleware/`
- RBAC is implemented in `infra/database/init/06_auth_tables.sql`

### Daemon / Autonomous Mode

The daemon (`services/daemon/`) runs as a separate process with its own orchestration loop (`python services/daemon/main.py`). It polls for new alerts, processes them through the AI pipeline, and can execute automated responses. Cost and resource guardrails are enforced by the orchestrator's budget seam (`services/daemon/orchestrator.py`), which refuses the next LLM call once `ORCHESTRATOR_MAX_COST`, `ORCHESTRATOR_MAX_HOURLY_COST` or `ORCHESTRATOR_MAX_RUNTIME` is hit.

Key config variables: `DAEMON_AUTO_TRIAGE`, `DAEMON_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`, `ORCHESTRATOR_MAX_COST`, `ORCHESTRATOR_MAX_HOURLY_COST`

---

## Code Conventions

### Python

- **Formatter**: Black, line length **88** (its default; pinned in `requirements-dev.txt`)
- **Linter**: Flake8 — gates CI. `E501` is off because black owns wrapping, so
  the only long lines left are strings black cannot split
- **Imports**: isort
- **Type hints**: mypy (ignore-missing-imports mode)
- **Async**: prefer `async def` for all service methods and route handlers
- File naming: `snake_case.py`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

### TypeScript / React

- **Framework**: React 18 + Vite 5 (not CRA)
- **UI**: Tailwind utility classes + the CSS custom properties in
  `clients/web/src/styles.css`. Reuse the primitives in
  `clients/web/src/shared/` (`ui.tsx`, `formKit.tsx`, `icons.tsx`) — there is no
  component library, so do not add one
- **State/data**: plain hooks (`useState`/`useEffect`) over the axios services;
  React Context for auth/theme/toasts
- **HTTP**: axios via `clients/web/src/services/`
- **Linter**: ESLint with `@typescript-eslint/recommended` + `react-hooks/recommended`
- Component files: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Service files: `camelCase.ts`
- Test files collocated: `Component.test.tsx`

### Commit Messages

- Required: DCO sign-off (`git commit -s`)
- Format: short summary line (≤50 chars) + optional body (wrap at 72)
- One logical change per commit
- Example: `git commit -s -m "Add SentinelOne MCP integration"`

### API Routes

Follow the existing pattern:
```python
# core/<domain>/your_feature_router.py   (or services/api/routers/your_feature.py)
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from core.storage.connection import get_db
from core.routing import Auth, RouterMeta

router = APIRouter()   # prefix/tags live in ROUTER_META, not here
ROUTER_META = RouterMeta(prefix="/api/your-feature", tags=["your-feature"], auth=Auth.REQUIRED)

@router.get("/")
async def list_items(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    return your_feature_service.list(db)   # sync Session — do not await it
```
No registration step — discovery mounts every module that exports a `router` and a `ROUTER_META`.

---

## Adding New Features

### New MCP Integration

1. Implement the MCP server as `core/integrations/<vendor>/tool.py` (or `tools/mcp/` for one that talks to Vigil's own services) — [vendor-slices.md](vendor-slices.md) has the HTTP conventions
2. Add the server definition to `mcp-config.json`
3. Expose via `core/integrations/mcp/service.py` if needed
4. Document in `docs/integrations/`

### New Agent

1. Add the agent record in `core/agents/builtins.py` (prompt text lives in `core/agents/prompts.py`)
2. Wire agent invocation in `core/llm/harness/claude.py`
3. Expose via `services/api/routers/agents.py`
4. Document in `docs/product/agents.md`

### New Workflow

1. Create `core/workflows/definitions/your-workflow/WORKFLOW.md` following existing format
2. Define agent sequence, tools, and phase instructions
3. Register in workflow service if needed

For a hypothesis-driven hunt instead of a phase chain, declare `run_kind: hunt`
and state `hypotheses` (required — a hunt with nothing to test is refused),
`attack_techniques` and `data_domains`. `playbook_resolver.resolve_hunt()` binds
the capabilities `services/agent/arch/threathunt.yaml` declares to whatever tools
the deployment carries, dropping any it has none for.

### New API Endpoint

1. Add the router module (with `router` + `ROUTER_META`) under `core/<domain>/` or `services/api/routers/`
2. Add service logic in `core/<domain>/` (or park it in `services/api/routers/` alongside the router)
3. Add Pydantic schema alongside the domain (e.g. `core/storage/schemas/workflow.py`) if needed
4. No registration — discovery mounts it automatically
5. Add corresponding frontend API call in `clients/web/src/services/`

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

| Workflow | Trigger | Jobs |
|----------|---------|------|
| `ci-cd.yml` | Push/PR to main, develop | Lint → Unit Tests → Integration Tests → Security Scan → Docker Build |
| `release-please.yml` | Push to `main`, manual | Read Conventional Commits since last tag → open/update a release PR with bumped `VERSION` / `Chart.yaml` (`appVersion` + `version`, lockstep) / `clients/web/package.json` / `clients/web/package-lock.json` + `CHANGELOG.md`. On merge, push `vX.Y.Z` tag and create the GitHub Release. See [releasing.md](releasing.md). |
| `release.yml` | Version tags (`v*.*.*`) | Build & push `vigil-backend` + `vigil-daemon` images to GHCR → sign the image digest with cosign (keyless) → generate + attest an SBOM → Trivy scans the signed digest → smoke-test that the images start → annotate the GitHub Release with image digests. **Publishes images only — it does not deploy.** Does **not** create the GitHub Release object either (release-please owns that). |
| `helm-chart.yml` | Push/PR touching `infra/helm/` | Verify `database/init/` ↔ chart-bundle copies are in sync (`diff -r`) → `helm lint`/`template` across default, dev, and Bitnami-subchart values → kubeconform → `ct lint` |
| `medic.yml` | Push/PR touching `services/medic/` or `infra/docker/Dockerfile.medic` | The Medic service has its own lock and its own gates, so it runs as its own path-filtered workflow rather than steps in `ci-cd.yml` |
| `nightly.yml` | Daily 2 AM UTC | Comprehensive security & performance audits |

CI runs:
- `black --check` + `flake8` + `isort --check` + `mypy` (Python)
- `eslint` (TypeScript)
- `hadolint` (Dockerfiles)
- `pytest --cov` (backend unit + integration)
- `vitest run` (frontend)
- `bandit` + `npm audit` (security)

All CI checks must pass before merging.

## Important Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `services/api/main.py` | FastAPI app entry, middleware wiring, startup/shutdown |

## Submodules

None — this repo has no Git submodules. `mempalace` (agent memory) was removed
as a submodule and dependency, and `deeptempo-core` and `mcp-servers` were
dropped earlier: the former had **no production importer** in this repo, and
the latter's four servers are vendored at `tools/mcp/`, reading Vigil's own
approval service, data service, `DatabaseService` and `get_integration_config`
rather than `deeptempo_core`'s.

Scope your pytest runs the way CI does (`pytest tests/unit/`,
`pytest tests/integration/`) — a bare `pytest` from the repo root finds no ini
file (see [Running Tests](#running-tests)).

## Security Notes

- Never commit secrets or API keys — use `.env` (gitignored)
- `DEV_MODE=true` disables all auth — **never enable in production**
- Default PostgreSQL password in `docker-compose.yml` must be changed for production
- Bandit runs in CI to catch common Python security issues
- MCP tool calls that perform actions (host isolation, firewall rules) require approval workflow by default — see `core/response/approval_service.py`
