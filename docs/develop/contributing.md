# Contributing to Vigil

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Vigil. This document covers how to get started, how to submit changes, and how to find things to work on.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker Desktop (must be running)
- Git with submodule support
- Claude API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)

### Local Setup

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil.git
cd vigil
./start.sh
```

Access the frontend at http://localhost:6988 and the API at http://localhost:6987.

See the [README](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/blob/main/README.md) for full setup instructions including manual install and Docker options.

## How to Contribute

### Fork and Pull Request Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository to your GitHub account
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vigil.git
   cd vigil
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Make your changes** and test them
5. **Commit** with sign-off (required — see below):
   ```bash
   git commit -s -m "Add new MCP integration for SentinelOne"
   ```
6. **Push** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
7. **Open a Pull Request** from your fork to `Vigil-SOC/vigil:main`

### Sign-Off Requirement (DCO)

All commits must include a `Signed-off-by` line certifying you have the right to submit the code under Vigil's Apache 2.0 license. This is the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/blob/main/DCO).

Add it automatically with the `-s` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This adds a line like `Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>` using your git config identity. Configure it once:

```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your@email.com"
```

### Versioning and Releases

Vigil follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). While in `0.x`,
minor version bumps may include breaking changes to agent prompts, workflow
schemas, and MCP integration interfaces. Patch bumps are always backward
compatible. See [`releasing.md`](releasing.md) for the full release process.

The Helm chart at `infra/helm/vigil/` has two version fields: `appVersion`
(the Vigil release the chart deploys) and chart `version` (the chart
packaging version). release-please bumps **both in lockstep** on every
release. See [`releasing.md`](releasing.md) for the rationale and the
escape hatch for chart-only changes between app releases.

## What to Work On

### Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled [`good-first-issue`](https://github.com/Vigil-SOC/vigil/labels/good-first-issue) — these are scoped, well-defined tasks suitable for new contributors.

### Using the Auto-Contributor

Vigil includes a competitive research tool in `contrib/auto-contributor/` that identifies capability gaps versus proprietary AI security platforms and generates contribution specifications. If you want to find meaningful work:

1. Pick a proprietary AI SOC or security platform
2. Run the auto-contributor skill to identify gaps
3. The output includes ready-to-file GitHub issues with acceptance criteria

See `contrib/README.md` for details.

### Contribution Areas

Contributions are welcome across all areas:

- **New MCP integrations** — connect Vigil to additional security tools (EDR, SIEM, cloud, ticketing)
- **Agent improvements** — enhance agent prompts, reasoning, or tool usage
- **New Workflows** — define new multi-agent workflows in `workflows/`
- **Detection rules** — add Sigma, Splunk, Elastic, or KQL rules
- **Bug fixes** — check the issue tracker
- **Documentation** — improve docs, add examples, fix errors
- **Tests** — expand test coverage

## Code Guidelines

### Project Structure

```
vigil/
├── core/            # Shared library: capability domains + storage/platform tier
│   └── workflows/definitions/   # Multi-agent workflow definitions (WORKFLOW.md files)
├── services/        # Deployables only: api (FastAPI + Agent SDK), daemon
│                    #   (headless autonomous SOC), worker (ARQ llm-worker)
├── clients/web/     # React web client
├── contrib/         # Community development tools (not runtime)
├── infra/           # Docker Compose, Helm chart, DB init SQL
├── data/            # Schemas, registry, taxonomy
├── docs/            # Documentation
└── tests/           # Test suite
```

### Style

`flake8`, `black` and `isort` gate CI over `services/` and `core/`. Install the
pinned toolchain and the hook that matches it once:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && pre-commit install
```

Pass the tools no arguments — `setup.cfg` is the only config, and pre-commit
reads the same file, so formatting locally cannot produce a tree CI rejects.
`./setup_dev.sh` does both steps for you.

- Python: follow existing patterns in `core/`. Use type hints. `core/` must not
  import `services/`, and `core/storage` + `core/platform` must not import a
  capability domain — `.importlinter` gates both; run `lint-imports` locally.
- TypeScript/React: follow existing patterns in `clients/web/`.
- Workflows: follow the format of existing
  `core/workflows/definitions/*/WORKFLOW.md` files.
- MCP servers: follow the patterns in `tools/`.

### Testing

Run the test suite before submitting:

```bash
./tests/run-tests.sh
```

New features should include tests. Place them in `tests/` following existing naming conventions.

### Commit Messages

We **prefer** [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) so we
can automate changelogs and version bumps via
[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) (see
[`releasing.md`](releasing.md)). It is not strictly enforced at the
per-commit level — if your individual commits don't match the format, please
update your **PR title** to follow the convention before requesting review
(since we squash-merge, the PR title becomes the commit on `main`). If you
forget, a maintainer may adjust the title before merging. The DCO sign-off
(`git commit -s`), however, is required on every commit.

The preferred format is:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <short summary>

<optional body explaining what and why>

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```

**Common types:**

- `feat:` — a new feature (triggers a minor version bump)
- `fix:` — a bug fix (triggers a patch bump)
- `docs:` — documentation only
- `chore:` — tooling, build, dependency bumps
- `refactor:` — code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test:` — adding or fixing tests
- `perf:` — performance improvement

**Common scopes for Vigil:** `agents`, `workflows`, `mcp`, `frontend`,
`daemon`, `helm`, `api`, `db`.

**Breaking changes:** add `!` after the type/scope (`feat!:`) or include
`BREAKING CHANGE:` in the body.

**Examples:**

```
feat(mcp): add SentinelOne integration
fix(daemon): prevent double-processing of correlated alerts
docs(workflows): clarify threat-hunt phase ordering
chore(deps): bump fastapi to 0.110.0
feat(agents)!: rename Triage agent prompt schema
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

- One logical change per PR
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update relevant documentation
- Reference related issues: "Closes #123" or "Part of #456"
- Keep PRs reviewable — if a feature is large, break it into smaller PRs

### Pull Request Titles

Because we squash-merge PRs, the PR title becomes the commit message on
`main` — which is what `release-please` reads to decide version bumps and
changelog entries. **Setting a Conventional Commits-style PR title is the
author's responsibility** (e.g., `feat(mcp): add SentinelOne integration`).
You can update the title at any point before merge by editing the PR. If
you forget, a maintainer may adjust it before merging, but please don't
rely on that.

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability
