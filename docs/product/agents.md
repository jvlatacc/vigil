# Agents

13 specialized AI agents for different security operations tasks.

## Tool Access

All agents have access to tools through two integration methods:

### Agent SDK (Recommended - Web UI)
- **19 Backend Tools** via Claude API function calling
- Security detections, case management, approvals, MITRE ATT&CK
- **Zero desktop dependency** - Works entirely through the API
- Production-ready for multi-user deployments
- Enabled by default in web UI

### MCP Tools (Optional - Advanced Use)
- **100+ Extended Tools** for specialized integrations
- Requires additional MCP server configuration
- Best for advanced local workflows or specialized integrations

> **Default Behavior**: Agents automatically use backend tools via Agent SDK in the web UI with no additional configuration needed.

## Workflows

These are executable multi-agent playbooks defined in the [`/workflows/`](/workflows/) directory. Each workflow has a `WORKFLOW.md` file with YAML frontmatter metadata and detailed phase-by-phase instructions.

Workflows can be executed from the **Workflows** page in the UI or via the `/api/workflows/{id}/execute` API endpoint.

| Workflow | Agents | Use Case | Workflow File |
|----------|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Incident Response** | Triage -> Investigator -> Responder -> Reporter | Active incident handling | [`workflows/incident-response/WORKFLOW.md`](/workflows/incident-response/WORKFLOW.md) |
| **Full Investigation** | Investigator -> MITRE Analyst -> Correlator -> Responder -> Reporter | Deep-dive analysis with ATT&CK mapping | [`workflows/full-investigation/WORKFLOW.md`](/workflows/full-investigation/WORKFLOW.md) |
| **Threat Hunt** | Hunt Lead over Threat Hunter, Network Analyst, Threat Intel | Proactive hypothesis-driven hunting | [`workflows/threat-hunt/WORKFLOW.md`](/workflows/threat-hunt/WORKFLOW.md) |
| **Forensic Analysis** | Forensics -> Malware Analyst -> Network Analyst -> Reporter | Post-incident forensics with chain of custody | [`workflows/forensic-analysis/WORKFLOW.md`](/workflows/forensic-analysis/WORKFLOW.md) |

**Threat Hunt is the one that is not a phase chain.** It declares `run_kind: hunt`
in its frontmatter, which routes it to the hypothesis loop: the definition states
`hypotheses`, `attack_techniques` and `data_domains`, and a Hunt Lead decides each
iteration what to do next from what the evidence has done to each belief. Its
`phases:` block is a roster of who may be dispatched, not an order — the workers'
prompts and tool grants live in `services/agent/arch/threathunt.yaml`. The other
four definitions are compose playbooks and walk their phases in order. A hunt run
reports hypotheses and their standing where a compose run reports phase rows.

### Adding Custom Workflows

Create a new directory under `workflows/` with a `WORKFLOW.md` file:

```
workflows/
  my-custom-workflow/
    WORKFLOW.md    # YAML frontmatter + markdown workflow definition
```

The backend discovers workflows automatically on startup. Use `POST /api/workflows/reload` to pick up changes without restart.

### Malware Analyst Agent
- Static/dynamic analysis
- Family classification
- IOC extraction
- C2 identification

## Approval Workflow Integration

All agents can submit actions to the approval queue:

| Confidence | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| >= 0.90 | Auto-approved, executed |
| 0.85-0.89 | Auto-approved with flag |
| 0.70-0.84 | Requires manual approval |
| < 0.70 | Monitor only |

## Usage Tips

1. **Match agent to task** - Use the specialist for your need
2. **Switch freely** - Change agents mid-conversation
3. **Start with Triage** - When unsure where to begin
4. **End with Reporter** - Document findings
5. **Use thinking agents** - For complex analysis (Investigator, Hunter, Forensics)
6. **Use fast agents** - For quick decisions (Triage, Responder)
