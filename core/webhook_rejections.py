"""Log and count inbound webhook rejections (401/503 auth or gate failures).

Shared by the API receivers and the daemon ingest webhook so a rotated or
mistyped secret leaves a trace instead of silently dropping alerts.

Everything is keyed on the fixed ``(endpoint, reason)`` pair supplied by the
call sites, never on client input, so memory stays bounded however hard the
endpoint is hammered. Callers must never pass secrets, tokens, signatures or
bodies in ``detail``.
