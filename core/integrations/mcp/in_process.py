"""Vigil's own tools, called directly instead of through a pipe.

Every other server in the registry is a program Vigil talks to: a vendor's, a
community one, something an operator installed. Vigil's own server was treated
the same way, which meant Vigil started a second copy of itself, held a pipe to
it, and serialised a call down that pipe to read its own database.

That cost more than the round trip. The child loads its own configuration, so
it can disagree with its parent; a crash in it arrives as a connection error
rather than a traceback; it needs connecting, enabling, reconnecting and a
status; and the caller's identity cannot cross a pipe, so work a person drove
was recorded as an agent's.

The tools are ordinary functions in this process. This calls them, and shapes
the answer the way the registry and the tool bridge already expect, so nothing
downstream has to know which side of the line a tool came from.

    That contract, from ``MCPClient.call_tool``: never raise, always a dict,
    ``error`` says whether this failed and ``content`` carries the answer. The
    layer above reads ``result["error"]`` to decide whether to raise
    ``MCPFailure`` and ``result["content"]`` to read rows, so a direct call
    that raised, or that spelled the key differently, would turn a tool's own
    failure into a crash or into a silent success.

    The timeout is kept for the same reason. A call down a pipe was bounded;
    a call to a function is not bounded by anything unless it is made so, and
    a tool that never returns would otherwise hold its caller forever.

    The one answer the pipe could not give — who called — is the audit row
    below: every call is recorded with the caller ``current_caller()`` names,
    or "agent" when none is bound, and the write is fail-closed like every
    audit row. A call whose row cannot land raises rather than answering as a
