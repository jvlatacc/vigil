"""The recall contract (#729), Python's half.

What a read of episodic memory returns, and the signature of the tool that
performs one. There is one shape, carried two ways: the run-start read journals
it verbatim as the recall event payload, and a mid-run :data:`RECALL_TOOL` call
carries the same mapping as the single row of a ``ToolResult``. A parallel
payload would be a second contract, and the second one drifts.

A mismatch between the halves fails as "no history", which is indistinguishable
from an entity nobody has looked at. The TypeScript half is
``services/agent/contracts/memory.ts`` and
``tests/unit/_ratchets/test_recall_contract_agrees.py`` fails when they
disagree — nothing calls either half yet, so a static check is the only one
available.
