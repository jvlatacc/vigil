"""Minting, checking and revoking the credentials programs use on MCP.

A session says a person signed in a moment ago. A credential here says a
program was given standing access by an operator who is not present. They are
different claims, so they are different things, and neither is accepted where
the other belongs: ``authenticate`` refuses anything that is not one of these,
and the session layer never sees one because it does not carry a session's
shape.

The token exists once, in the return value of :func:`mint`. What is stored is a
SHA-256 of it. Nothing can recover it, so an operator who loses one mints
another and revokes the first -- which is the behaviour we want anyway, and the
reason revocation is cheap.
