"""Approval service for managing pending autonomous actions.

Actions are persisted in the ``approval_actions`` table (#128). Prior
to that migration, pending actions lived in ``data/pending_actions.json``
— fine for the daemon's single-process loop but invisible to the API
and with no FK into workflow runs. The DB move gives us a queryable,
joinable surface that links workflow phase approvals back to the run
they paused.

Public API (``create_action``, ``approve_action``, ``reject_action``,
``mark_executed``, ``mark_failed``, ``list_actions``, ``get_action``)
is intentionally preserved so ``daemon/orchestrator.py`` (and any
other existing callers) keep working.
