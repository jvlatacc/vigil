"""The confidence band for autonomous response, in one place (#916).

Every comparison against a confidence — the approval gate, the correlator's
recommendation ladder, the daemon's response queue and severity floors, and the
band text the agents are prompted with — reads a field here, so raising a
threshold in env moves every branch rather than one. Defaults are the literals
the code carried before, so a default install behaves as it did.

Lives in ``core/`` because ``core`` must not import ``services``;
``services.daemon.config`` re-exports it as part of ``DaemonConfig``.
