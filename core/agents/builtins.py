Each built-in is a plain record shaped like a ``custom_agents`` row so
built-ins and customs build through the same path
(``core.agents.manager.SOCAgentLibrary.build_profile``). The decision-log
action id (GH #476) is folded in as ``decision_id``.

Confidence bands are never typed here as numbers. The ``$auto_approve``,
``$review`` and ``$monitor`` placeholders are filled from ``ResponseConfig``
at profile-build time
