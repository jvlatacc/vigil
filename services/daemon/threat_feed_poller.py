"""Periodic pollers for threat-indicator freshness.

Two sources share this module. The TAXII poller (`ThreatFeedPoller`) pulls
STIX 2.1 indicators from configured feeds (Cloudforce One et al); registered
as a scheduled task by `daemon/scheduler.py` when the `cloudforce_one`
integration is enabled, no-op when disabled. After the upsert loop it offers
the poll's uncovered indicators to the Intake as one case-less
`kind="schedule"` row carrying every key (#1009). It does not open the hunt;
the drain tick launches it.

The CISA KEV refresher (`run_kev_refresh_once`) keeps the bundled t=0 seed
(`core/threat_intel/kev_seed.py`) current against the official catalog:
daily, env-gated, no key required. It runs the seed's own mapper, so bundled
and refreshed rows cannot drift apart.
