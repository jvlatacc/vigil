"""Known-answer probes (#923, epic #884).

Three synthetic findings the daemon feeds itself once a day so that store →
triage → LLM gateway is exercised end to end on a known input. A probe is a
Finding with ``data_source = "probe"`` whose known answer rides in
``entity_context["probe"]["expected"]``; it goes onto the processor's own input
queue like any polled finding and stops after triage (see the guard in
``FindingProcessor._enrich_in_background``). An hour after creation
``score_probes`` (#924) grades the triage that landed in
``ai_enrichment["ai_triage"]`` against that answer and writes the result to
``entity_context["probe"]["score"]``.
