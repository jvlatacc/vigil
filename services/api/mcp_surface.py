"""Serving Vigil's own MCP server at /mcp, to callers that are not Vigil.

The same server the agent calls directly in this process, given an address.
Nothing about a tool changes: what changes is that a request arrives from
somewhere, so it has to say who it is, and what it does is recorded against
that person rather than against "an agent".

Three gates, in order, because each one's answer means something different:

* **Closed.** The surface is off, and a 404 says so. Not 403: a door nobody
  opened should not announce that it exists and is locked.
* **Unauthenticated.** No credential, or one that does not work -- minted or
  IdP-issued alike. 401 with a challenge, and the same answer for every way a
  credential can fail.
* **Open.** The principal is bound for the duration of the call, which is what
  ``caller()`` reads when a tool records who did something.

    A Starlette mount at ``/mcp`` compiles to ``^/mcp/(?P<path>.*)$``, so the
    bare spelling -- the one MOUNT_PATH, the README and env.example all
    advertise, and the one anyone configuring a client will paste -- does not
    match it. What answers instead depends on what else is registered:

    * With no frontend build, nothing matches, and Starlette's redirect_slashes
      rescues it with a 307 to the slash form.
    * With a frontend build, the SPA catch-all claims every path. It is GET-only,
      so a POST matches it by path and not by method -- a partial match, which is
      still a match, so the search stops and answers 405 and the redirect never
      runs. The gate is never reached.

    Since CI never builds the frontend, only the first case is ever exercised
    there, which is why a surface unreachable in every real install looked fine.

    Rewriting the path here rather than registering a second route puts this
    ahead of routing, so it cannot be decided by what is registered around it.
