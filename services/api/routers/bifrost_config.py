"""Authenticated passthrough to Bifrost's config API.

Bifrost's own config store is the source of truth for providers, keys, model
allow-lists, pricing and governance. This router is the console's only door to
it: Bifrost itself runs with admin auth disabled on a private network, so the
gate has to live here.

Three things it does beyond forwarding. The first two are because Bifrost's key
API cannot be driven honestly without them (see ``core.llm.bifrost.admin`` for
how those were learned); the third is because the rest of Vigil does not read
Bifrost:

* **Secrets stay ours.** A key's plaintext is mirrored into the secrets store
  under ``llm_key_<key_id>`` on write and dropped on delete, so credential
  rotation and backup keep working against ``~/.vigil/secrets.enc`` rather than
  a container volume.
* **Masked values are never round-tripped.** Reads come back masked
  (``sk-a****key``) and Bifrost accepts a write that echoes the mask, storing
  the mask as the credential — every call then 401s with nothing to say why. A
  write that carries no new secret has the stored one substituted in.
* **A key write mirrors a provider row.** Vigil indexes providers by
  ``llm_provider_configs``, so a key that exists only in Bifrost is unreachable
  to the model picker, to assignments, and to dispatch — see
  ``core.llm.bifrost.mirror``.

    Two providers break the plain ``value`` shape:

    * **Vertex** authenticates one of two ways. A *service account* is scoped
      by ``project_id``/``region`` under ``vertex_key_config`` and carries its

      at all. The presence of that block is therefore what marks the mode.
      Either credential is mirrored to ``value`` so a single ``llm_key_<id>``
      ref backs the key, and an edit that leaves the credential blank
      substitutes the stored copy back in.
    * **Ollama** carries its endpoint under ``ollama_key_config`` and a bearer
      token, when the endpoint wants one, under ``value``. Both read back
      masked, so both are substituted from our own copies.

    ``provider`` comes from the request path. Keying Ollama on its block
    instead sent an edit that did not retype the URL -- which omits the block
    -- down the API-key path, where it was refused for want of a credential
    Ollama does not have. Vertex still keys on its block, because there the
    block *is* the statement: a service account sends one and an express-mode
    API key does not.
